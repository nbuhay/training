## Introduction

BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) is a transformer-based model designed to understand the context of words in a sentence. Fine-tuning BERT on specific tasks allows the model to adapt its pre-trained knowledge to particular applications, such as sentiment analysis. In this project, we fine-tune BERT to classify IMDB movie reviews as either positive or negative.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

- Python 3.6 or higher
- PyTorch
- Transformers library from Hugging Face
- Datasets library

A GPU is recommended for faster training but is not mandatory.

## Installation

1. **Clone the Repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone TODO
   ```

2. **Navigate to the Project Directory:**

   ```bash
   cd TODO
   ```

3. **Install Required Packages:**

   ```bash
   pip install torch transformers datasets
   ```

## Dataset

The IMDB dataset consists of 50,000 movie reviews labeled as positive or negative. We utilize the `datasets` library to load and preprocess this dataset.

## Fine-Tuning the Model

The fine-tuning process involves:

1. **Loading the Pre-trained BERT Model:**

   We use the `BertForSequenceClassification` model with a classification head suitable for binary classification.

2. **Tokenizing the Dataset:**

   The `BertTokenizer` converts text data into tokens that the BERT model can process.

3. **Training the Model:**

   Utilizing the `Trainer` and `TrainingArguments` classes from the `transformers` library, we configure and initiate the training process.

For a detailed walkthrough of the code and explanations, refer to the [Fine-Tuning BERT for Sentiment Analysis: A Practical Guide](https://medium.com/@heyamit10/fine-tuning-bert-for-sentiment-analysis-a-practical-guide-f3d9c9cac236).

## Evaluation

After training, the model is evaluated on a test set to assess its performance. Metrics such as accuracy and F1-score are used to determine the model's effectiveness in classifying sentiments.

## Usage

To use the fine-tuned model for predicting the sentiment of new movie reviews:

1. **Load the Fine-Tuned Model:**

   ```python
   from transformers import BertForSequenceClassification

   model = BertForSequenceClassification.from_pretrained('./results')
   ```


2. **Tokenize the Input Text:**

   ```python
   from transformers import BertTokenizer

   tokenizer = BertTokenizer.from_pretrained('bert-base-uncased')
   inputs = tokenizer("Your movie review here", return_tensors="pt", padding=True, truncation=True)
   ```


3. **Make Predictions:**

   ```python
   outputs = model(**inputs)
   predictions = torch.argmax(outputs.logits, dim=1)
   sentiment = 'Positive' if predictions.item() == 1 else 'Negative'
   print(f'Sentiment: {sentiment}')
   ```
